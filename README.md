# Heat Kernel Signature

A project on implementing Heat Kernel Signature with Python and Tensorflow as described in [1]. 

Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) is a geometry descriptor based on the heat kernel. The HKS is a function of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">, which simplifies the Heat Kernel which is a function of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">. Briefly, heat kernel could be interpreted as amount of heat diffused from a point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> to another point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y"> in time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">, while heat kernel signature could be interpreted as the amount of heat diffused from a point <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> back to itself in time <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t">. This allows a reduction in the number of dimensions (from 3 to 2) for a geometry descriptor.

In this project, computation of heat kernel signature is implemented for a mesh using the Mesh Laplacian Operator, L, which is the discrete approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As mentioned above, the details of the method could be found in [1].

- To demonstrate the usage of the module, a notebook is created: `Implementation_of_HKS.ipynb`.
- To demonstrate an application of HKS, a notebook is created: `Optimisation_with_HKS.ipynb`.

The following images show the HKS computed for a cow mesh and a Homer mesh using the implementation in this project.

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center">Cow mesh</th>
      <th style="text-align:center">Homer mesh</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <img border="0"  src="Images/hks_cow.png" width="200" height="200">
      </td>
      <td align="center">
        <img border="0" src="Images/hks_homer.png" width="200" height="250">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The following gif and image shows the output of the second notebook on the application of HKS. The smoothed mesh is transformed via optimisation of the error between the HKS's of the smoothed mesh and ground truth (its original mesh before smoothing). The gif shows the smoothed mesh at each iteration as it slowly transforms into the original mesh.

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center">Smoothed mesh</th>
      <th style="text-align:center">Original mesh</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
        <img border="0"  src="Images/bunny_gif.gif" width="400" height="400">
      </td>
      <td align="center">
        <img border="0" src="Images/bunny_mesh.png" width="400" height="400">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
